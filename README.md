# Token-Swap
this is a token swap which I created with the reference of moralis Web3 youtube tutorial

In this tutorial I have used
1. React to create a User Interface to swap tokens
2. Moralis Api to fetch realtime prices of tokens
3. Wagmi to connect to wallet
4. 1inch Aggregator to make swaps in realtime
